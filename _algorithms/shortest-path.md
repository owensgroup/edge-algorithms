title: Single-Source Shortest Path (Example)
summary: Minimal example showing how an EDGE algorithm page is structured.
tags: [shortest-paths, graphs, demo]
status_intro: |
  This is a demo algorithm page. Replace each section with your EDGE content.
  You can include inline math like $d_i$ and display math like:
  $$d_i = \min_j (d_j + w_{ji})$$
problem_statement: |
  Define the shortest path problem in the EDGE notation and set up inputs/outputs.
working_example_part1: |
  Provide a small graph and initialize values.
working_example_part2: |
  Walk through one or two iterations of the algorithm.
edge_expression_walkthrough: |
  Explain each line of the EDGE expression in words.
edge_expression: |
  $$d_i \leftarrow \min_j (d_j + w_{ji})$$
other_notes: |
  Add any additional clarifications or assumptions here.
variants: |
  Mention any common variants (e.g., different semirings, constraints).
implementation_notes: |
  Notes about efficient implementation or data structures.
complexity_costs: |
  Provide time and space complexity in Big-O notation.
related_notes: |
  Link to related EDGE expressions or algorithms.
